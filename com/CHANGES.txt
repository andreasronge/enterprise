1.5 (2011-10-18)
----------------

1.5.M02 (2011-10-10)
--------------------
o Server limits the number of unread chunks to send to the client, preventing unecessary memory hogging.
o Server-side exceptions are serialized to the client and thrown there instead of slave getting read timeouts.
o Changed configuration names to reduce confusion: 'zoo keeper' -> 'coordinator', 'machine' -> 'server'.
