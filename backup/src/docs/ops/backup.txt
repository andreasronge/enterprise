Backup
======

NOTE: The Backup features are only available in the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.

Backups are performed over the network live from a running graph database onto a local copy.
There are two types of backup: full and incremental.

A _full backup_ copies the entire store files from the source database and is required in order to, at a later time, do an incremental backup.

An _incremental backup_ will only retrieve and apply the changes since the most recent full or incremental backup.
Because of that incremental backup is much more efficient than doing full backups every time.

The database to be backed up is specified using a URI with syntax

<running mode>://<host>[:port]{,<host>[:port]*}

Running mode must be defined and is either _single_ for non-HA or _ha_ for HA clusters. The <host>[:port] part
points to a host running the database, on port _port_ if not the default. The additional _host:port_ arguments
are useful for passing multiple ZooKeeper instances

[IMPORTANT]
Backups can only be performed on databases which have the configuration parameter `enable_online_backup=true` set.
That will make the backup service available on the default port (6362).
To enable the backup service on a different port use for example `enable_online_backup=port=9999` instead.

== Embedded and Server ==

To perform a backup from a running embedded or server database run:
[source,shell]
----
# Performing a full backup
./neo4j-backup -full -from single://192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from single://192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup where the service is registered on a custom port
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from single://192.168.1.34:9999 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
----

== High Availability ==

To perform a backup on an HA cluster you specify one or more ZooKeeper services managing that cluster.
[source,shell]
----
# Performing a full backup from HA cluster, specifying two possible ZooKeeper services
./neo4j-backup -full -from ha://192.168.1.15:2181,192.168.1.16:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup from HA cluster, specifying only one ZooKeeper service
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from ha://192.168.1.15:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup
